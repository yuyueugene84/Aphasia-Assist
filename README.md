Gotcha-Input
============
This is a group project I participated on back in Spring 2013, it is a class project for NTU CSIE department's 
Advanced Human Computer Interaction class.

It is an Android input method designed for people with aphasia. 
It helps its users to find the term or concept they wish to express by describing it.
The user can either by typing or saying other words that relates to the desired term or concept, 
and Gotcha will use ConceptNet, a sementic network, to find the term or concept that is relevant
to all the description words.
